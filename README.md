# TerminalGUI for UNIX

## Very simple terminal GUI which can be primarily used for games, but also for other GUI stuff

Primarily uses termios to setup terminal and then ANSI Escape Sequences to navigate cursor and change settings like color, background/foreground color etc. There is also ability to enter alt screen and save current terminal settings so that after you exit your app, the terminal will not be glitched
